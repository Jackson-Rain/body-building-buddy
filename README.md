## Body Building Buddy
This is an exercise routine generator that periodically rings a bell and tells you to do some amount of a user-defined exercise. You can either wait for the bell, or hit the fast-forward button to get the next prompt right away.

Your exercise history is logged for you, so you can copy/paste it into a file or something to keep track of your progress.

### Usage:
The project was generated with create-react-app, so first you need to build it.

# In the main directory:
npm install
npm run build

# And then serve it somehow. One easy way:
npm install -g serve
serve -s build

and then connect to http://localhost:5000 in a browser of your choice

that is... if you DARE!
